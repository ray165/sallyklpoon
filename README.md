### Hey hey, I'm Sally! 👋
(she/her)


🌱 I’m currently learning to program and do \~schnazzy\~ computer things in BCIT's Computer Systems Technology program.

🐍 Python is the language I'm currently coding in, but I'm also learning HTML/CSS and some Java!

Having worked with fantastic research supervisors and bad\*ss womxn, I am all about empowerment for womxn in tech and advocacy for mental health.

⚡ Fun fact: my Chinese name, in Mandarin, sounds like "ice cream"! 🍦 (I speak both Cantonese and Mandarin)
