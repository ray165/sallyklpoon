### Hi there, I'm Sally! 👋

(she/her)

🌱 I’m currently learning to program and do snazzy computer things at BCIT's Computer Systems Technology program.

🐍 Python is the language I'm currently coding in! But I'm also learning HTML/CSS and some Java

I advocate for mental health as a Crisis Line volunteer and, having worked with fantastic research supervisors and bad&#42ss womxn in the pass, am all about empowerment for womxn in tech!

⚡ Fun fact: I'm a proud Chinese-Canadian and my name in Mandarin, sounds like "ice cream" in that language! 🍦
