### Hey hey, I'm Sally! 👋
(she/her)


🌱 I’m currently learning to program and do \~schnazzy\~ computer things in BCIT's Computer Systems Technology program.

🐍 Python is the language I'm currently coding in, but I'm also learning HTML/CSS and some JavaScript!

⚡ Fun fact: my Chinese name, in Mandarin, sounds like "ice cream"! 🍦 (I speak both Cantonese and Mandarin)
