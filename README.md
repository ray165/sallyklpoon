### Hey hey, I'm Sally! 👋
(she/her)


🌱 I’m currently learning to program and do \~schnazzy\~ computer things as a co-op student in BCIT's Computer Systems Technology program.

🐍 Python is the language I'm currently coding in, but I can also code in HTML5, CSS, and Javascript!

⚡ Fun fact: my Chinese name, in Mandarin, sounds like "ice cream"! 🍦 (I speak both Cantonese and Mandarin)

🤓 What I'm currently learning: React Native

📝 On my list of things to learn next: Java ☕
