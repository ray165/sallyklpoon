### Hey hey, I'm Sally! 👋
(she/her)


🌱 I’m currently learning to program and do \~schnazzy\~ computer things in BCIT's Computer Systems Technology program.

🤖 I can code in Python, Javascript and do fun web things with HTML 5, CSS 3, and React

⚡ Fun fact: my Chinese name, in Mandarin, sounds like "ice cream"! 🍦 (I speak both Cantonese and Mandarin)

🤓 Currently learning: Procedural Programming in C, Object Oriented Programminig in Java, and self-teach Data Structures and Algorithms
