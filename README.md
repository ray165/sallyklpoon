### Hi there, I'm Sally! 👋

(she/her)

🌱 I’m currently learning to program and do ~schnazzy~ computer things in BCIT's Computer Systems Technology program.

🐍 Python is the language I'm currently coding in! But I'm also learning HTML/CSS and some Java

Having worked with fantastic research supervisors and bad\*ss womxn in the pass, I am all about empowerment for womxn in tech and advocacy for mental health.

⚡ Fun fact: I'm a proud Chinese-Canadian and my name in Mandarin, sounds like "ice cream" in that language! 🍦 (I speak both Cantonese and Mandarin)
